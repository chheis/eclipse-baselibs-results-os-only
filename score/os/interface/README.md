# Operating System Headers and Identifiers

The package contains files that document which headers and identifiers from the OS are safe and which ones are unsafe.

Note: There's an AUTOSAR document named [Specification of Operating System Interface](broken_link_a/artifactory/list/vulcan-amsr/standard/adaptive_AUTOSAR_19.03/AdaptiveFoundation/AUTOSAR_SWS_OperatingSystemInterface.pdf) that describes a similar set of interfaces, but doesn't provide information about the safety of the interfaces.

## Operating Systems

* [Linux](linux/README.md)
* [QNX](qnx/README.md)
